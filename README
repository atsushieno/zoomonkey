Zoomonkey is a prezi[*1]-like presentation tool based on Silverlight and Moonlight.

I have no documentation so far, but you might be able to create your own presentation with your own "zmdata.json" file.

Basically, the presentation data has a set of image files and action lists.
Images are loaded dynamically from the URLs, and actions are mapped to [<<] and [>>] buttons.

So far it's quite simple. Advanced features may come later.
