Zoomonkey is a prezi[*1]-like presentation tool based on Silverlight and Moonlight.

I have no documentation so far, but you might be able to create your own presentation with your own "zmdata.json" file.

Basically, the presentation data has an optional xaml file, a set of image files and action lists.
XAML UI element and Images are loaded dynamically from the URLs, and actions are mapped to [<<] and [>>] buttons. It would be quite useful to just load xaml.

You can see a sample running online [*2].

So far it's quite simple. Advanced features may come later.
